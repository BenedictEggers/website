Welcome to my corner of the Internet.

I'm currently completing my B.S. in Computer Science and my B.S. in Mathematics at the University of Washington. I also like playing guitar, rock climbing, reading, playing chess, and building things (<a href="http://github.com/BenedictEggers">GitHub</a>).

For the next few months, I will be posting regular updates about my life in Budapest and the misery of having to use a USB typewriter to interact with my computer. Read all about it <a href="/typewriter.html">here</a>.
