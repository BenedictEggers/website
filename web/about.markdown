title: About
---

I'm currently completing my B.S. in Computer Science and my B.S. in Mathematics at the University of Washington. I also like playing guitar, rock climbing, reading, playing chess, and building things (<a href="http://github.com/BenedictEggers">GitHub</a>).

Email is the best way to contact me: ben [at] beneggers [dot] com. If you're in the Seattle area, let me take you out for coffee! I love hearing what other people are working on.

This site was built using <a href="http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>, an awesome static site generator for Haskell.
